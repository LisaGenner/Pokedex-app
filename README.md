# Pokedex-app

# Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

# Key Features

● Load data from an external source (API).

● View a list of items

● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item


# Technical Requirements

● The app loads data from an external API, the Pokémon API.

● The app displays a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.

demand, when clicking on a list item.

● CSS is used to style the app.

● The JavaScript code is formatted according to ESLint rules, via Prettier.

○ The app allows searching for a Pokémon.

● The app is deployed to a publicly accessible platform in GitHub Pages.

● The app works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11
