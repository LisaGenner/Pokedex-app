# Pokedex-app

# Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

# Key Features

● Load data from an external source (API)

● View a list of items

● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item


# Technical Requirements

Required:

● The app loads data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.

● The app displays a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.

● The app is enabled to view more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.

● The app must have CSS styling.

● The JavaScript code is formatted according to ESLint rules, via Prettier.

○ The app allows searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).

● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).

● The app works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11

   you will see 150 Pokemon which can be changed to additional by changing the limit to as many as you want to see
            "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150";.
