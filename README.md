# Pokedex-app

# Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# Context
The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that programming language.
This project aims to do just that—have you build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web
application. Since you haven’t yet learned how to build your own API, you’ll be relying on an external
data source for this project.
It’s best to have complete projects that you can showcase in your portfolio. For this reason, it’s
important that you don’t limit your focus to JavaScript and JavaScript alone, but, instead, consider the
app as a whole, including high-quality HTML and CSS. Your app should not only work, but be
aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, as well. No one expects you to be a designer (nor to have the
perfectly designed app a designer would have), but your final app shouldn’t look like a half-finished
prototype.

# In the following sections, you’ll find more information regarding the requirements for your app.
The 5 Ws
1. Who—Your professional network, as well as potential employers.
2. What—A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.
3. When—Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like
GitHub or GitLab.
4. Where—Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code
directly from your GitHub repository or be directed to your GitHub profile from your
portfolio site (your project from Intro to Frontend Development).
5. Why—For your potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how you create
the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how you test and debug your code.

# User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

# Key Features
● Load data from an external source (API)
● View a list of items
● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

# Technical Requirements
Required:
● The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
● The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
● The app must have CSS styling.
● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11

   you will see 5 Pokemon which can be changed to additional by changing the limit to as many as you want to see
