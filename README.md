# Pokedex-app

# Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# Context
The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that programming language.
This project aims to do just that—have you build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web
application. Since you haven’t yet learned how to build your own API, you’ll be relying on an external
data source for this project.
It’s best to have complete projects that you can showcase in your portfolio. For this reason, it’s
important that you don’t limit your focus to JavaScript and JavaScript alone, but, instead, consider the
app as a whole, including high-quality HTML and CSS. Your app should not only work, but be
aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, as well. No one expects you to be a designer (nor to have the
perfectly designed app a designer would have), but your final app shouldn’t look like a half-finished
prototype.

# In the following sections, you’ll find more information regarding the requirements for your app.
The 5 Ws
1. Who—Your professional network, as well as potential employers.
2. What—A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.
3. 
4. When—Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like
GitHub or GitLab.
5. Where—Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code
directly from your GitHub repository or be directed to your GitHub profile from your
portfolio site (your project from Intro to Frontend Development).
6. Why—For your potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how you create
the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how you test and debug your code.
